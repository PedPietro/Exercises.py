This repository brings together Python exercises that I have done and continue to do to reinforce and improve my knowledge. It covers everything from basic to advanced concepts, following my progress. In addition to being a record of my learning, it also serves as a resource for those who want to practice and share knowledge about Python. 🚀🐍
